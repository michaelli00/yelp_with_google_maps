React App using Yelp API and Google Maps (https://mli25782.github.io/yelp_with_google_maps/)

![](/images/app.png)

Plots the nearest 50 restaurants from current location on a map with clickable markers that show an info window with relevant information, including a link to the yelp review page. Also includes a search bar on the left that dynamically filters the markers displaying on the map and shows a list of the filtered restaurants with their rating stars based on Yelp Reviews.

Next step for the app is to be able to plot more markers by using multiple fetch calls from the Yelp API, using the offset parameter to get results beyond the first 50, add a clicking functionality to the search list that pop ups the marker on the map when clicked, include more relevant info on the info windows, and make the app look prettier :smiley:.
